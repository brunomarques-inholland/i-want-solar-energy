                <h2>Solar panels</h2>
                <p>Solar panels are made out of photovoltaic cells (which is why generating electricity with solar
                    panels is also called solar PV) that convert the sun’s energy into electricity.</p>
                <p>Photovoltaic cells are sandwiched between layers of semi-conducting materials such as silicone. Each
                    layer has different electronic properties that energise when hit by photons from sunlight, creating
                    an electric field. This is known as the photoelectric effect – and it’s this that creates the
                    current needed to produce electricity.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="article2">
                <h2>Charge Controller</h2>
                <p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array. It
                    ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day, and that the power doesn’t
                    run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are
                    available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is
                    its primary job.</p>
                <p>Basically a solar charge controller is a regulator for your solar battery that prevents it from
                    overcharging.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="article3">
                <h2>Battery System</h2>
                <p>A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use. The solar battery extends the use of
                    a PV-system’s generated energy and will provide free, sustainable power even when the sun is not
                    shining and the panels don’t produce energy.</p>
                <p>Therefore, with a solar battery little to no electricity is fed into the grid while also avoiding
                    having to buy expensive electricity from the grid later. Due to the increased self-consumption, the
                    electricity costs decrease significantly. You will pay less per used kWh.</p>

            <article class="article4">
                <h2>Direct Current power</h2>
                <p>Direct current (DC) is an electric current that is uni-directional, so the flow of charge is always
                    in the same direction. As opposed to alternating current, the direction and amperage of direct
                    currents do not change. DC power is widely used in low voltage applications such as charging
                    batteries so is used in many household electronics and in all devices that use
                    batteries.</p>
                <p>Direct current (DC) electricity is what solar panels produce and what batteries hold in storage.</p>

            <article class="article5">
                <h2>Power inverter</h2>
                <p>A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current
                    to alternating current. The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling
                    depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry.</p>
                <p>Basically a solar inverter is a low level computer installed alongside the other components of your
                    solar energy system that “inverts” your energy from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="article6">
                <h2>Alternating Current Power</h2>
                <p>Alternating current (AC) power is the standard electricity format that comes out of outlets. The name
                    comes from the waveform the current takes. To understand the composition of the AC wave, you need to
                    understand that electrical currents come from a flow of electrons.</p>
                <p>Alternating current (AC) electricity is the type used on the grid and in most household devices.
                    Meaning it is the type of electricity we need to use our devices.</p>
