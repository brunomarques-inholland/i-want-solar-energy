                <h2>Solar panels</h2>
                <p>Solar panels are made out of photovoltaic cells &#40;which is why generating electricity with solar
                    panels is also called solar PV&#41; that convert the sun&#8217;s energy into electricity&#46;</p>
                <p>Photovoltaic cells are sandwiched between layers of semi&#45;conducting materials such as silicone&#46; Each
                    layer has different electronic properties that energise when hit by photons from sunlight&#44; creating
                    an electric field&#46; This is known as the photoelectric effect &#45; and it&#8217;s this that creates the
                    current needed to produce electricity&#46;</p>
            </article>
            <article class="article2">
                <h2>Charge Controller</h2>
                <p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array&#46; It
                    ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day&#44; and that the power doesn&#8217;t
                    run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries&#46; Some charge controllers are
                    available with additional capabilities&#44; like lighting and load control&#44; but managing the power is
                    its primary job&#46;</p>
                <p>Basically a solar charge controller is a regulator for your solar battery that prevents it from
                    overcharging&#46;</p>
            </article>
            <article class="article3">
                <h2>Battery System</h2>
                <p>A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use&#46; The solar battery extends the use of
                    a PV&#45;system&#8217;s generated energy and will provide free&#44; sustainable power even when the sun is not
                    shining and the panels don&#8217;t produce energy&#46;</p>
                <p>Therefore&#44; with a solar battery little to no electricity is fed into the grid while also avoiding
                    having to buy expensive electricity from the grid later&#46; Due to the increased self&#45;consumption&#44; the
                    electricity costs decrease significantly&#46; You will pay less per used kWh&#46;</p>

            <article class="article4">
                <h2>Direct Current power</h2>
                <p>Direct current &#40;DC&#41; is an electric current that is uni&#45;directional&#44; so the flow of charge is always
                    in the same direction&#46; As opposed to alternating current&#44; the direction and amperage of direct
                    currents do not change&#46; DC power is widely used in low voltage applications such as charging
                    batteries so is used in many household electronics and in all devices that use
                    batteries&#46;</p>
                <p>Direct current &#40;DC&#41; electricity is what solar panels produce and what batteries hold in storage&#46;</p>

            <article class="article5">
                <h2>Power inverter</h2>
                <p>A power inverter&#44; or inverter&#44; is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current
                    to alternating current&#46; The input voltage&#44; output voltage and frequency&#44; and overall power handling
                    depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry&#46;</p>
                <p>Basically a solar inverter is a low level computer installed alongside the other components of your
                    solar energy system that &#34;inverts&#34; your energy from direct current &#40;DC&#41; to alternating current &#40;AC&#41;.

            </article>
            <article class="article6">
                <h2>Alternating Current Power</h2>
                <p>Alternating current &#40;AC&#41; power is the standard electricity format that comes out of outlets&#46; The name
                    comes from the waveform the current takes&#46; To understand the composition of the AC wave&#44; you need to
                    understand that electrical currents come from a flow of electrons&#46;</p>
                <p>Alternating current &#40;AC&#41; electricity is the type used on the grid and in most household devices&#46;
                    Meaning it is the type of electricity we need to use our devices&#46;</p>
